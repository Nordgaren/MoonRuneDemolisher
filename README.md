# Moon Rune Demolisher
Auto-translates specific Dark Souls game files with google translate.

## What It Do
* Command line only!
* Can translate loose param files. Use Yabber to unbind the parambnd files first.
* Can translate event names of MSB files.
* Does not translate region names in MSB files. Those name are sensitive as events reference regions by name.
* In order to use this program you will need a google translate api key.

## Translated Files
* If you just want the translated vanilla files download TranslatedSouls.zip

## Special Thanks
* **TKGP** [SoulsFormats library](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats).
